### ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Marissa Christenson

I'm a new software developer who recently graduated from University of Washington Bothell's graduate certificate program in software design and development. The dive into topics related to algorithms, designing, and testing to more advanced topics of systems programming and software engineering and security were reinforced with several projects, discussions, and collaborative work with a diverse cohort. How this program has benefited me cannot be overstated. I've gained new knowledge and acquired skills that I'm ready to put to the test and continue strengthening. Paired with my Bachelor of Science in physiology, an interplay of biology and technology has given me unique perspective that I look forward to sharing with you!  

Outside of software, I enjoy...

* Reading of all kinds, but I often delight in sci-fi and fantasy
* Playing board games with friends- I recommend Blokus
* Breakfast- It's the most important and tastiest meal of the day
* Playing with my cats Sherwood and Mildred
